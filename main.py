# Alyssa McCurdy - COP 1500 - Integration Project

# I will be writing my integration project over ADHD because I find it interesting and an important subject to talk
    # about. A lot of people will get distracted more than usual and then say they have
    # ADHD/ADD without actually going in for a proper test. It puts out a bad stigma around
    # and it makes people believe it is not as bad as it seems. For this project I want
    # to explain how ADHD affects the brain and society as a whole. I also picked this subject
    # because no one has ever told me to "embrace" my ADHD and that *really* stuck with me.
    # So I decided to create a program that can educate others about ADHD. :)

# I broke up different sections of work with lines so it would be easier for me to read the code
    # and not feel overwhelmed, but I am making sure to include extra lines of code to make sure
    # I meet the minimum. I just tend to overwhelm my eyeballs.

# I am going to be attaching a document to all the websites I used as well as labeling in the code.
    # All works cited comments will be in parentheses
