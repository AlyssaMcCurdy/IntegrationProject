.) Temporal Lobe ADHD include symptoms such as irritability, aggression, paranoia, and mood instability. Children with this form of ADHD can experience memory issues and may hear or see things that do not exist. Dark thoughts are hightened with this form of ADHD along with Overfocused ADHD. Quick light and sound changes can also result in headaches due to where this form is found in the brain
.) Limbic ADHD comes paired with a low-fucntioning form of depression (although it is not referred to as depression) along with low energy, and low self-esteem.
.) Ring of Fire ADHD is a type of ADHD that exhibits extreme emotions. These emotions are primarily emotions connected to irritability and anger. They can also experience mood swings and, similar to Temporal Lobe ADHD, can be highly sensitive to lights, noises, touch, and clothes. This ADHD occurs because there is too much going on in the brain at once and the person becomes overwhelmed.

This ADHD can also disrupt how an adult or child reacts to certain situations and circumstances because of high stress levels.
